# Authentication

To use our API you need to authenticate using a valid API token that has the right scopes.  

When using such a token you will be able to act on behalf of the ClearFacts user that created the 
token, or allowed for it be created.

A token can be acquired in two ways, depending on your use case:

* **Personal access token** — It's possible to create a token manually using the web application.
* **Open Connect Id** — This allows users to grant your application access to our API using an online flow integrated into your web application.
