Welcome to the ClearFacts Developer Documentation. 
We offer an open API available to all our users, partners and app developers.

In this documentation you'll find information on how to authenticate and connect to our API as well as in depth information on the functionality it exposes.

### Technology
* Our API is not a REST API, instead we use the [GraphQL](#graphql) specification. 
* For connecting to the API you need a token.  Tokens can be created [manually](#personal-access-token), or through [OpenID Connect](#openid-connect).

### Getting help
If you have any questions regarding our api please contact our developer support via email at *dev-support at clearfacts dot be*.

### Using this documentation
You can view code examples in the area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.
